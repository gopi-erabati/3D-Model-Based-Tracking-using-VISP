# 3D-Model-Based-Tracking-using-VISP

I tried to track a 3D model (box) in a sequence of images using tracking functions of VISP library. I have done 3D model object detection, tracking, computing pose using VISP library. I had seen great advantages of this library as I am able to track and detect using a single line of code and the data structures defined for holding data are well defined and the class and methods used in the library are well documented with many examples.
